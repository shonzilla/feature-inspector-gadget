November 11, 2009

The first and also a proof-of-concept version.

Originally, gadgets.util.hasFeature was intended to be used for querying features 
supported by the container. Unfortunately, gadgets.util.hasFeature is useless 
(until and including OpenSocial 0.9) since it only checks for features that are 
declared by gadget itself and not whether container supports a feature.

Because of this, whether a given gadget feature is supported or not is checked 
in custom way using callback methods.
